# Messaging Queues
A message queue is a software engineering component used for communication between processes or between threads within the same process. Message queues provide an asynchronous communication protocol in which the sender and receiver of messages don't need to interact at the same time. Messages are held in queue until the recipient retrieves them. 

## Why Message Queues are used?
Let's break it down to something very plain and simple:

* **Message:** Applications communicate by writing and retrieving inbound and outbound data (messages) in a queue.
* **Queue:** A queue eliminates the need for applications to send and receive at the same time.
